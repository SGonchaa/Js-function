1. Declare a function fullName and it prints out your full name.
2. Declare an arrow function fullName and now it takes firstName, lastName as a parameter and returns your full name.
3. A perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as follows: perimeter= 2x(length + width). Write a function that calculates perimeterOfRectangle.
4. Body mass index(BMI) is calculated as follows: bmi = weight in Kg / (height x height) in m2. Write a function that calculates BMI. BMI is used to broadly define different weight groups in adults 20 years old or older. Check if a person is underweight, normal, overweight, or obese based on the information given below.
The same groups apply to both men and women.
Underweight: BMI is less than 18.5
Normal Weight: BMI is 18.5 to 24.9
Overweight: BMI is 25 to 29.9
Obese: BMI is 30 or more
5. Math.max returns its largest argument. Write a function findMax that takes three arguments and returns their maximum without using Math.max method. 
 console.log(findMax(0, 10, 5)) -> 10
 console.log(findMax(0, -10, -2)) -> 0.
6. Declare a function name. It takes an array as a parameter and it returns the reverse of the array (don't use method).
 console.log(reverseArray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  -> [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
 console.log(reverseArray(['A', 'B', 'C'])) -> ['C', 'B', 'A']
7. Write a function pow(x,n) that returns x in power n. Or, in other words, multiplies x by itself n times and returns the result.
pow(3, 2) -> 3*3 = 9
pow(3, 3) -> 3 * 3 * 3 = 27
pow(1, 100) -> 1 * 1 * ...* 1 = 1
